# 🌿 Pied Piper — Middle-Out Compression Platform

> "Making the world a better place through scalable, fault-tolerant compression algorithms."

## What is Pied Piper?

Pied Piper is the revolutionary compression platform that's going to change the way we think about data. Our proprietary **middle-out compression** algorithm achieves compression ratios that were previously thought to be mathematically impossible.

We're not just building a product. We're building a **new internet** — a decentralized, peer-to-peer network where every device becomes a node in the most efficient data storage system ever created.

## Technical Specifications

| Metric                | Value                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Compression Ratio** | 5.2x average          |
| **Weissman Score**    | 5.2 (industry record) |
| **Peer Network**      | 50,000+ active nodes  |
| **Data Processed**    | 12 PB and counting    |
| **Latency**           | < 3ms per operation   |

## Features

- 🗜️ **Middle-Out Compression** — Our patented algorithm compresses from the middle outward, achieving unprecedented ratios
- 🌐 **Decentralized Storage** — Your files are distributed across our peer network, encrypted and redundant
- 📊 **Real-time Analytics** — Monitor compression performance, peer connectivity, and storage utilization
- 🔒 **End-to-End Encryption** — Military-grade encryption on every file, every transfer
- ⚡ **8x Faster** — Get more done in less time with our optimized pipeline

## Two Visual Modes

- **Classic Mode** — The original Pied Piper SaaS dashboard, as seen in the early beta
- **Modern Mode** — The sleek, dark marketing landing page for the new era

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Runs on **port 5050**.

## Disclaimer

This is a parody project inspired by HBO's _Silicon Valley_. Pied Piper is a fictional company. No actual middle-out compression algorithms were harmed in the making of this application. The Weissman Score of 5.2 is, sadly, not real.

This project is not affiliated with HBO, Silicon Valley, or any real compression technology company. It's just a tribute to one of the greatest tech comedies ever made.
