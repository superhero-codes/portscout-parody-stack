# RockNRoll — Parody 🎸

A very important developer tool. Definitely not a Rick Roll. Please visit the URL below for critical security updates.

## What it Parodies

Rick Rolling — the internet's greatest tradition. But for developers.

## How to Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then visit http://localhost:5324 for an important security briefing.

## Port

- **Server**: 5324

## Features

- **Autoplays video on load**: You know which one
- **Developer-themed lyrics**: "Never gonna give you uptime"
- **Escape button**: It doesn't work. Nothing works. You're stuck.
- **Floating music notes**: For ambiance
- **All routes redirect home**: /escape, /exit, /stop — they all lead back

## Notes

- The page title says "Important Security Update" to maximize the surprise
- Autoplay requires browser interaction first (thanks, Chrome)
- The escape attempt counter persists across clicks
- We're not sorry
