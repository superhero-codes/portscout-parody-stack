# MySpice — Parody 🌶️

Like MySpace, but spicier. It's 2005 and everything is beautiful.

## What it Parodies

MySpace — the social network that defined a generation. Complete with Top 8 friends, visitor counters, and marquee text.

## How to Start

```bash
php -S localhost:5323
```

That's it. No npm. No webpack. No build step. Just PHP, the way the internet gods intended.

## Port

- **Server**: 5323 (⚠️ conflicts with SubSnack — cross-technology: PHP vs Node.js)

## Stack

- **PHP** — no frameworks, no Composer, no modern tooling
- **Pure HTML/CSS** — inline styles, because that's how we rolled in 2005
- **`<marquee>`** — yes, really

## Features

- **2005 MySpace aesthetic**: Blue background, orange accents, Verdana font
- **Random profiles**: Tom, xX_DarkAngel_Xx, GlitterQueen2005
- **Top 8 Friends**: The most important social feature ever invented
- **Visitor counter**: You are visitor #847,293
- **Blinking stars**: CSS animation, not the `<blink>` tag (we have _some_ standards)
- **Marquee text**: Scrolling welcome message
- **PC4PC comments**: Comment on mine and I'll comment on yours!!

## Requirements

- PHP 7.0+ (just needs the built-in server)
- No Composer
- No dependencies
- No dignity

## Notes

- No modern build tools were used or harmed
- The `<marquee>` tag is deprecated but our nostalgia isn't
- Tom is still everyone's first friend
