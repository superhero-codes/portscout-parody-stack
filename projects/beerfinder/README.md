# BeerFinder — Parody 🍺

Find craft beer near you. A geo-based brewery search parody. Because life's too short for bad beer.

## What it Parodies

Beer/brewery finder apps — with a modern landing page and mock geo-search.

## How to Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Port

- **Server**: 4321 (non-standard, because beer doesn't follow rules)

## Stack

- **Node.js + Express** — serving beer data since 2026
- **Qwik-inspired** — resumable, like your bar tab

## Features

- **Geo-based mock search**: Pretends to use your location
- **Modern dark landing page**: Amber/gold beer theme
- **Brewery cards**: Names, ratings, distance, beers on tap
- **Map placeholder**: We spent the map budget on beer

## Brewery Highlights

- Hoppy Days Brewing Co. (IPA Specialists)
- The Frothy Mustache (Belgian & Sours)
- Yeast Mode Activated (Experimental Brews)
- Stout of This World (Stouts & Porters)
- The Pint-ernet (Everything on Tap)

## Notes

- Port 4321 is intentionally non-standard
- No actual geolocation is used
- All brewery data is mocked
- Please drink responsibly
