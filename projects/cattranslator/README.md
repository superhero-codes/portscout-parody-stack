# CatTranslator 🐱

Translate between human and cat. Finally understand what your cat is saying.

## How to Run

Open `index.html` in a browser. That's it. No npm. No build step. No node_modules. Just vibes.

```bash
open index.html
```

## Port

None. It's a static HTML file. It doesn't need a port. It doesn't need anything. Like a cat.

## Notes

- Pure HTML/CSS/JS
- No dependencies
- No package.json
- The translations are random because cats are unpredictable
