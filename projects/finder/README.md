# Finder — Parody 🔥

Swipe right on code. A Tinder parody for developers who can't commit (to a framework).

## What it Parodies

Tinder — the dating app. But instead of people, you're swiping on programming languages and frameworks.

## How to Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Port

- **Dev Server**: 5173 (Vite default)

## Stack

- **Svelte** — because it compiles away, just like your matches
- **Vite** — fast builds for fast swipes

## Features

- **Swipe UI**: Swipe left to reject, right to match
- **Framework profiles**: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, jQuery, and more
- **Match tracking**: See your matches at the bottom
- **Clean modern design**: Gradient background, card animations
- **Mocked backend**: No actual dating algorithm (just like the real thing)

## Profiles Include

- React (has commitment issues)
- Vue (approachable and reactive)
- Angular (opinionated, enterprise only)
- Svelte (compiled and ready to mingle)
- jQuery (old school but still got it)
- COBOL (65 years old, still running your bank)

## Notes

- No backend required — all data is mocked in the Svelte component
- The swipe animations are CSS-based
- No actual frameworks were harmed in the making of this parody
