# Lotion - Notion Parody

A Notion-style workspace parody for PortScout demo purposes.

## What it Parodies

Notion - the all-in-one workspace for notes, docs, and project management.

## How to Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Port

- **HTTP**: 5301 (configured in `vite.config.js`)

## Notes

- This project is part of the intentional port conflict with SpotiPie (both use port 5301)
- Single-page mock UI with fake workspace/pages
- Dark mode friendly
