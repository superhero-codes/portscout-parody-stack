Welcome to the **PortScout Parody Stack** — a lovingly crafted collection of 26 fake-but-functional web apps that parody the tech giants you know and ~~love~~ tolerate. Each project is a real, runnable application built with real frameworks, real tooling, and absolutely zero real business models.

**Why does this exist?** Because [PortScout](https://portscout.app) needed a playground full of misbehaving dev servers, port conflicts, slow backends, and monorepo madness. Think of it as a petting zoo, but instead of goats, it's full of `node_modules`.

## 🎭 The Lineup

_Twenty-six apps walk into a port range..._

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Individual Projects

```bash
cd projects/<project-name>
npm install   # or pnpm install for monorepos
npm run dev   # or pnpm dev for monorepos
```

### Install Everything (Go Make Coffee)

```bash
# Install dependencies for all projects in one go
./scripts/install-all.sh
```

> **Heads up:** This installs npm + pnpm dependencies across many projects. Your internet connection will be tested. Your patience will be tested more.

### All Projects at Once (Chaos Mode)

```bash
# Unleash all apps simultaneously. Your CPU will love you.
./scripts/start-all.sh

# When you've seen enough
./scripts/stop-all.sh
```

> **Pro tip:** Running all projects at once is a great way to test your laptop's fan speed. Especially with MemEater and CPUStorm in the mix.
